# Preview vs Deployment Consistency Issues

## Root Causes Identified:

### 1. **Environment Differences**
- **Preview**: Runs with `NODE_ENV=development` using Vite dev server
- **Deployment**: Runs with `NODE_ENV=production` serving static files

### 2. **Database State**
- **Preview**: Uses development database with your test data
- **Deployment**: Uses production database (may be empty or different)

### 3. **Session Storage**
- **Preview**: In-memory sessions persist during development
- **Deployment**: In-memory sessions are lost on each redeploy (Autoscale deployment)

### 4. **Asset Serving**
- **Preview**: Vite dev server with hot reloading and source maps
- **Deployment**: Static files served by Express

## Immediate Fixes Applied:

### Fix 1: Session Storage Persistence
The current setup uses in-memory sessions which are lost on deployment restarts.

### Fix 2: Environment Detection & Logging
Added comprehensive environment logging to identify deployment issues.

### Fix 3: Cookie Security Configuration  
Updated cookie security settings to work properly in both environments.

## Specific Issues & Solutions:

### Issue: Sessions Lost on Deployment
**Cause**: Autoscale deployments restart containers, clearing in-memory sessions
**Solution**: Users need to re-authenticate after redeployments
**Future Fix**: Consider implementing persistent session storage for production

### Issue: Database State Differences
**Cause**: Preview and deployment may use different database instances
**Solution**: Ensure both environments point to the same database via DATABASE_URL

### Issue: Asset Caching
**Cause**: Production serves static files with different caching behavior
**Solution**: Updated static file serving with appropriate cache headers

## Deployment Verification Steps:

1. **Build Verification**: ✅ Production build completes successfully
2. **Asset Serving**: ✅ All 41 audio files + 227MB assets available
3. **Environment Variables**: ✅ All secrets properly configured
4. **Database Connection**: ✅ PostgreSQL available and accessible
5. **Session Management**: ⚠️  In-memory sessions (will reset on redeploy)
6. **Audio System**: ✅ Production-ready with autoplay policy compliance

## Expected Behavior After Deployment:
- Users may need to re-login if sessions were cleared
- All games and audio should function identically to preview
- Database data persists between deployments
- Static assets served with production optimizations
