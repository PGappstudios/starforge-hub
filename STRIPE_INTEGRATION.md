- **POST /api/stripe/webhook** - Handle Stripe webhook events
- **GET /api/stripe/payment-history** - Get user payment history

### Security Features
- Input validation using Zod schemas
- Amount and credits verification
- Rate limiting preparation

## 📦 Credit Packages

| Package | Credits | Bonus | Price | Popular |
|---------|---------|-------|-------|---------|
| Starter Pack | 100 | 0 | $4.99 | No |
| Gamer Pack | 250 | 50 | $9.99 | Yes |
| Pro Pack | 500 | 150 | $19.99 | No |

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables Required

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```bash
# Stripe Configuration
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here

# Session Secret
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret_here
```

### Stripe Dashboard Setup
1. Create a Stripe account at https://dashboard.stripe.com
2. Get your API keys from the Developers section
3. Set up webhooks pointing to your `/api/stripe/webhook` endpoint
4. Configure webhook events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`

## 💻 Development Mode

In development mode:
- Uses test Stripe keys
- Payments are simulated (no actual charges)
- Credits are added immediately upon "payment"
- Webhook verification is relaxed

## 🔄 Payment Flow

1. User selects a credit package
2. Stripe checkout modal opens
3. Payment intent is created via API
4. In test mode: Credits added immediately
5. In production: Webhook confirms payment and adds credits
6. Success/failure feedback shown to user
7. Payment recorded in history

## 📊 Testing

### Test Credit Purchase
1. Navigate to `/credits` page
2. Click "Purchase with Stripe" on any package
3. In test mode, payment will succeed immediately
4. Credits should be added to user account
5. Transaction appears in payment history

### API Endpoints Testing
```bash
# Test package retrieval
curl http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/packages

# Test payment intent (requires authentication)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/create-payment-intent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"packageId": "starter", "amount": 499, "credits": 100}'
```

```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- All amounts validated server-side
- Package IDs verified against allowed packages
- User authentication required for all payment operations
- Webhook signature verification in production
- Input sanitization with Zod schemas
- Rate limiting preparation for payment attempts

## 🚧 Production Deployment

### Before Going Live:
1. Replace test Stripe keys with live keys
2. Configure production webhook endpoints
3. Set up proper rate limiting
4. Enable webhook signature verification
5. Configure proper logging and monitoring
6. Test with small amounts first

### Environment Variables for Production:
```bash
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_live_publishable_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_live_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_live_webhook_secret
NODE_ENV=production
```

## 📱 Mobile Compatibility

- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly buttons and forms
- Mobile-optimized payment flow
- Stripe Elements automatically adapt to mobile

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Subscription-based credit packages
- [ ] Discount codes and promotions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Payment not working**: Check Stripe keys are correctly set
2. **Webhook failing**: Verify endpoint URL and secret
3. **Credits not added**: Check webhook event processing
4. **CORS errors**: Ensure proper session handling

### Debug Mode:
- Set `NODE_ENV=development` for detailed logging
- Check browser console for Stripe errors
- Monitor server logs for API responses
- Use Stripe Dashboard for payment tracking
